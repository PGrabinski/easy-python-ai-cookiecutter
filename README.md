# Easy Python AI Engineering Cookbook

This repository contains a [Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) template for people who do NOT want to spend too much time on Python logistics

# Motivation

In ML/AI research, we praise ourselves that many publication in our discipline come with code. Ergo, they are reproducible.

Not realy. From my experience, many modern, meaning dating 2018 or later, papers' repositories lack proper requirements or other intructions on environment setting. This renders them unreproducible and almost useless.

This is understandible as the Rsearchers most of the time are NOT Software Engineers and they use the simplest tools available.

With such people in mind, I've prepared this cookiecutter template, so they get a good start without diving into the rabbit hole of Python tooling.

I've read [Hypermodern Python Tooling by Claudio Jolowicz](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hypermodern-python-tooling/9781098139575/), so they don't have to.

This repository is supposed to bring the most development value for the least knowledge and effort required.
